1.  Difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2 :

   HTTP: 
               HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is a Client - Server communication. The user sends request to the server and the server sends response to user.

      1. Multiplexing:

                    HTTP 1.1: HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
                                                                   
                    HTTP 2:  Single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

      2. Server push:

                   HTTP 1.1: The server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it.

                   HTTP 2:   Allows a server to PUSH content to a client before the client asks for it.

      3. Header Compression:

                  HTTP 1.1: It compresses data by itself.

                  HTTP 2: It uses HPACK for data compression.

      4. Format:

                HTTP 1.1: It works on Textual  format.

                HTTP 2:  It works on  Binary  format.

2. Objects and its Internal representation:

    1.Objects are variables. But objects can contain many values.

    2.Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value seperated by colon).

    3.Object is a collection of named values (properties).

    4.All Javascript values except primitives are objects.

    5.Objects are MUTABLE. (can be changed) They are addressed by reference, not by value.

    6.JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods.

Internal Representation:

    1.name : value pairs in curly braces { } :
                     Ex: const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

    2. Empty Javascript object and adds properties :
                     Ex: const person = {};
                           person.firstName = "John";
                           person.age = 50;

    3. Using Javascript keyword new:
                   Ex: const person = new Object();
                           person.firstName = "John";
                           person.age = 50;

    4. Undefined:
                  Ex: person.myName;  (not null)

    5. Using bracket notation [array]:
                 Ex: person["age"]= 50;
                     Property name can be a string or anything that can be converted to a string including empty string.

    6. Using Object.create() method:
                   Ex: var Animal = {
                              type = 'Carnivore',
                    displayType = function ();
                   }
                        var animal1 = Object.create(Animal);
                        animal1.displayType();
                       o/p: Carnivore

    7.Using Constructor:
                       Constructor is nothing but function with the help of  new  keyword.
                            Ex: function Vehicle(name,make){
                                        this.name = name;
                                        this.make = make;
                                       }
                                   let car1 = newVehicle('Fiesta', 'Ford');
                                   console.log(car1.name);  o/p: Fiesta.
